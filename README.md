# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

Iâ€™m **Jakob** (he/him), an entomologist and Masterâ€™s student with a focus on **weevils** and biodiversity. While Iâ€™m not a programmer, Iâ€™m exploring how a bit of coding, useful tools, and biodiversity data standards can make life as an entomologist easier.

### About Me
- **Entomologist**: I'm interested in everything, but with a special focus on weevils (Coleoptera: Curculionoidea)
- **Linux & Command Line user**: I prefer working in a minimal yet powerful environment.
- **LaTeX Enthusiast**: I appreciate the simplicity and structure of LaTeX for writing technical documents.

### Currently Learning
- **Python**: Exploring its potential for data management and task automation.
- **Biodiversity Data Standards**: Diving into frameworks for managing biodiversity information.
- **Collections Management Systems**: Investigating how they could benefit the amateur entomology community.
