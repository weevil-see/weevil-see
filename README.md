# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

Iâ€™m **Jakob** (he/him), an entomologist and Masterâ€™s student with a focus on **weevils** and biodiversity. While Iâ€™m not a programmer or data scientist, Iâ€™m exploring how a bit of coding, useful tools, and biodiversity data standards [can make life as an entomologist easier](https://gist.github.com/weevil-see).

I use github mainly to get support for technical issues with various programs/data standards, and to host my blog at [https://weevil-see.github.io/](https://weevil-see.github.io/). Rarely I contribute to other repos.

### About Me
- **Entomologist**: I'm interested in everything, but with a special focus on weevils (Coleoptera: Curculionoidea)
- **Linux & Command Line User**: Using Windows I had the feeling the computer does not even belong to me.
- **LaTeX Enthusiast**: I appreciate the simplicity and structure of LaTeX for writing technical documents.

### Currently Learning
- **Python**: Exploring its potential for data management and task automation.
- **Biodiversity Data Standards**: Diving into frameworks for managing biodiversity information.
- **Collections Management Systems**: Investigating how they could benefit the amateur entomology community.
